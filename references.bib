abstract = {We revisit the negative association between ethnic diversity and development to show how the diversity-development association is conditional on spatial segregation. We introduce a new census-scale micro-dataset from the Indian state of Karnataka (n = 36.5 million rural residents). Using the first-ever spatially explicit enumeration and coding of endogamous Indian caste groups (jatis), we develop a multi-group metric for measuring local spatial segregation. We find that diversity is a bane for development only when it is also accompanied by high levels of spatial segregation. Our results contribute to the emerging research on the implications of inter-group contact and spatial proximity for economic outcomes.}

 abstract = {The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index (P̃*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index (H̃), a spatial relative diversity index (R̃), and a spatial dissimilarity index (D̃). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index P̃*-which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments-and the spatial information theory index H̃-which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual-are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

abstract="Indian society is characterised by significant horizontal (religious, regional, linguistic) and vertical (income, occupation, caste) divisions. These socio-economic fragmentations significantly shape the production of space in cities. In fact, all major cities in the country are pervaded by socio-spatial divides, which often become sources of conflict, violence, exclusion and, also, solidarity. Mumbai is the industrial, commercial and financial capital of the country. Bollywood has, over the years, helped in carving out a distinct (pan) Indian identity for itself and the city, both within and outside India, and is a major rallying and unifying aspect for India. Among all its glitter, the city is also infamous for its underworld (originating from its excluded and marginalised neighbourhoods), slums and poor residential areas. The city is pervaded by socio-spatial fragmentation and is a divided city. This chapter shows that the highest level of segregation in Mumbai is based on religion (Muslims and Non-Muslims), followed by class, caste and tribe.",
